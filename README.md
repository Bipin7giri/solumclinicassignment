# Web Developer Technical Test

This repository contains three independent tasks corresponding to the technical assessment folders `task 1`, `task 2`, and `task 3`. Each task can be executed on its own; follow the setup instructions below.

## Task A – `task 1`

- **Language:** Python
- **Entry point:** `index.py`
- **Run:** `python3 index.py`
- **Description:** Demonstrates the alternating sum pattern logic described in the assessment. Edit the input arguments in the `calculate_sum` call as needed.

## Task B – `task 2`

- **Language:** Python
- **Entry point:** `index.py`
- **Run (interactive):** `python3 index.py`
- **Run (from file/stdin):** `python3 index.py < input.txt`
- **Input format:** First line contains the number of test cases `t`. Each subsequent line contains one integer `n`, representing total propulsion units. Program prints either `-1` (if no solution) or the minimum and maximum number of crafts.

## Task C – `task 3`

- **Stack:** Next.js (React + TypeScript)
- **Install dependencies:** `cd task\ 3 && npm install`
- **Development server:** `npm run dev`
- **Production build:** `npm run build`
- **Preview production build:** `npm run start`
- **Notes:** The folder contains a standalone Next.js app with its own configuration and README for additional UI details. Make sure you are using Node.js 18+.
